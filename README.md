# Java-Instant-Messenger
# A simple instant messenger using Java (Client-Server)
This Instant Messenger is built in Java. It has two programs - one is the server (handling server side logic) and the other is the client (used for connecting to the server). 
Both client and server use GUIs. 
In a client server architecture clients and servers communicate on a network on separate hardware but they may reside in the same system.

# IM Architecture
- ClientClass.java: Responsible for handling connection to the server. ClientClass implements a GUI for the user to send/receive messages to/from the server. 
- ServerCLass.java: Responsible for connecting to the client and receiving/sending messages from/to the client. ServerClass also implemets a GUI which serves the same purpose as in the ClientClass.
